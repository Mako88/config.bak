			Checkbox list with select All/None at top.
			Backup/Cancel buttons.

Restore
	Backup Location
		Default: ~/backup
		On "OK", check that files.list exists in the base backup directory, if not, "Not a valid backup".
	Files to Restore
		Restore type: Ask, Replace, Merge, Concat
		Expandable checkbox list of files.list by category. (If error.list exists, create category "Error" with files in error.list at top)
	Restore
		If "Ask" was set, ask for each file. Otherwise perform the selected action. (Replace makes a file.bak backup of each replacement, merge keeps anything that's the same between the files, and concats the rest.)
		"<X> Files successfully restored. <Y> files could not be restored (maybe because you're not root?). These files have been saved in error.list in the backup folder. If you run config.bak again, you will be able to restore these files separately."
